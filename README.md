# Servicer
CI/CD Automation Framework

The primary goal of this framework is to completely automate creating, updating, and removing an environment (a collection of services). To accomplish this, this framework executes in your CI environment (eg: Bitbucket Pipelines, Gitlab, Jenkins, CircleCI, etc) and uses cloud infrastructure provider libraries (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc).

The `servicer.py` script is responsible for orchestrating the creation and removal of the services for a project, using a provided `services.yaml` project configuration file.

## services.yaml ##
The services config file supports environment variable substitution using the `${MY_VAR}` format.

Example config file for a deploying an AWS RDS instance and GCloud Kubernetes cluster from Bitbucket Pipelines CI:
```
ci:
  providers:
    - bitbucket
  image: python:3.6.4

providers:
  aws:
    libraries:
      - awscli==1.15.49
      - boto3==1.7.48
  gcloud:
    auth_script: auth/gcloud.sh
    libraries:
      - google-api-python-client==1.6.5

services:
  postgres:
    provider: aws
    service_type: rds_instance

    config:
      rds_params:
        AllocatedStorage: 256
        DBInstanceClass: db.m4.large
        DBInstanceIdentifier: ${PROJECT_NAME}-${SERVICE_ENVIRONMENT}
        DBName: ${DATABASE_NAME}
        Engine: postgres
        MasterUsername: ${DATABASE_USERNAME}
        MasterUserPassword: ${DATABASE_PASSWORD}
        PubliclyAccessible: true
        StorageEncrypted: true
        StorageType: gp2 # General purpose SSD
        Tags:
          - Key: project
            Value: ${PROJECT_NAME}
        VpcSecurityGroupIds:
          - sg-12345678 # default

  api-django:
    docker: true
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    provider: gcloud
    service_type: kube_cluster

    steps:
      build:
        commands:
          - docker build . -t ${PROJECT_NAME}-api
      test:
        commands:
          - ./util/install-docker-compose.sh
          - docker-compose -f docker-compose-test.yml up --abort-on-container-exit
```

## Environment ##
The framework requires several environment variables to be configured which control the parameters of each service. Some of these environment variables will be automatically pulled from your CI environment, and converted using a CI Adapter. The remaining variables may be specific to each service adapter, and will need to be configured in your CI environment.

To make it easy to test deployments in your local environment, servicer will automatically read from an `.env.yaml` file in your servicer configuration directory, if it exists. It is recommended to add this file to your `.gitignore`, as it is only intended to be used for local development and manual environment creation.

Example:
```
# build/.env.yaml
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: us-east-2
BRANCH: env-test
BUILD_NUMBER: '0001'
DATABASE_NAME: my_db
DATABASE_USERNAME: postgres
DATABASE_PASSWORD: XXX
GCLOUD_KEY_FILE_PATH: /Users/me/my_gcloud_credentials.json
GCLOUD_COMPUTE_REGION: us-central1
GCLOUD_COMPUTE_ZONE: us-central1-f
PROJECT_NAME: my-project
SERVICE_ENVIRONMENT: test
```

## Usage ##
```
servicer
```
This will deploy an environment using the `SERVICE_ENVIRONMENT` or `BRANCH` environment variables, in that order. For the example `.env.yaml` above, the resulting environment would be called `test`.

For the simplest use case of Servicer, simply add this command to your CI workflow, and each of your services will be deployed each time your CI workflow runs.

```
servicer --service=foo
```
This will deploy only the service with name `foo`.

```
servicer --step=build,test
```
By default, servicer executes only the deploy step for your services.
This command will execute and `build` or `test` steps present in your config file.

## Service Adapters ##
The fundamental building block of Servicer is a service. In order to create and destroy these services, servicer uses Service Adapters, which provide an interface between Servicer and each cloud provider's API or library. These Service Adapters can be either a python class called `Service` with `up` and `down` methods, or a shell script with `up` and `down` functions.

The `up` method is responsible for both creating and updating the service. Similarly, the `down` method is responsible for tearing down and removing the service. For this framework to function as expected, both methods *must* be *idempotent*.

Servicer provides default Service Adapters for your convenience. Please explore the `builtin/service_adapters` directory to see what's available for each cloud provider. In order to customize servicer to your needs, you can create your own Service Adapters in your project. By default, servicer will prefer service adapters found in the `.servicer/service_adapters` directory of your project.

## CI Adapters ##
In order to standardize the environment Servicer runs in, a CI Adapter is used. Each CIAdapter is a python class that populates an instance variable called `env_map`, which contains key value pairs mapping environment variable names to their standardized Servicer equivalents.

Servicer provides default CI Adapters for your convenience. Please explore the `builtin/ci_adapters` directory to see what's available for each CI provider. In order to customize servicer to your needs, you can create your own CI Adapters in your project. By default, servicer will prefer CI Adapters found in the `.servicer/ci_adapters` directory of your project.

## Selective Builds ##
For each service, you can optionally specify paths in your project that should trigger servicer to build, test, or deploy that service. Use `watch_paths` and `ignore_paths` to specify which files to match. Supported formats are simple text with `*` as a wildcard, or full regexes in the format `/.*/`. If no `watch_paths` or `ignore_paths` are provided, the service will be built every time.

For example, this pypi service will only build, test, or deploy when a file inside project folder `servicer` is changed.
However, if `servicer/README.md` changes, the pypi service will still not build, test, or deploy, because `*README.md` is ignored at the project level.
```
git:
  ignore_paths:
    - *README.md

services:
  pypi:
    provider: pypi
    service_type: pypi

    git:
      watch_paths:
        - servicer/*
```
